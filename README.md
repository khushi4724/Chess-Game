# Chess-Game
The chess game can be run by running Game.java as Game.java implements Runnable.
I've made a class for each piece - king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn.
I've also included the possibility of castling and en-passent.
GameBoard.java handles the color, shape, size, etc of the pieces and the board.
The board is represented as a 2d array and the pieces are referred by the row and column index rather than the standard chess notations.
